# SamJSON

A JSON Library made only trough graphing to be used by modders that use the UnrealEngine (ARK, ATLAS, ...)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the assets to be used in your own mods.

### Prerequisites

UnrealEngine (Full or DevKit for modding Games)


### Installing

* Download the assets from Git (You should have a folder "ArkZeroRP" and a sub sub-folder "SamJSON")
* Copy the folder ArkZeroRP to your "Mods" folder so that you have the following structure "/Game/Mods/ArkZeroRP/SamJSON/*"
* Start your Engine/DevKit and navigate to "/Game/Mods/ArkZeroRP/SamJSON" (you should see two Blueprints and two Folders)
* Open "SamJSON_ExampleSingleton" to see examples of how to use the "SamJSON" Blueprint that is the JSON Library Itself
* (ARK/ATLAS)You can add "SamJSON_ExampleSingleton" to your singletons list in the PrimalGameData to execute it in PIE and see the examples in action or add your own tests
* One you are ready to integrate this into your mod, you can Move the files(folders) into your own mod folder, but do so using the Engines Content Browser so the references don't break.
